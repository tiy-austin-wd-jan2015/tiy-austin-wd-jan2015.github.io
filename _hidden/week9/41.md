# Day {{ page.day }} : {{page.time}}


## Today we covered

* Photoshop and Illustrator. See supplementary resources section for details.
* Jekyll
* Content is number one. [Content precedes design](http://www.zeldman.com/2008/05/06/content-precedes-design/)
* Reminder: Design is number one, but when you get stuck or aren't sure where to go, TRUST YOUR GUT. You're learning as a designer, and you're all extremely rough on yourself about where you think you need to be. I'll let you know where you need to be. You should until then, learn to trust your gut, and be okay with making mistakes and learning from them :)
