## Homework
Everyday a bit of written, audio, or video resources will be assigned to review, which will supplement class assignments. Assignments are always due by 8:59am of the following day, unless noted.

### Supplemental Resources (required reading)

* [Building a great web design portfolio](http://speckyboy.com/2011/05/08/building-a-great-web-design-portfolio-10-best-tips-40-examples/)
* [Help! My portfolio sucks](http://alistapart.com/column/help-my-portfolio-sucks)
* [Redesigning your own site](http://alistapart.com/article/redesigning-your-own-site)

### Assignments

Before attempting to start sketching portfolio ideas, look at the links *above in the class notes* to search for other portfolios and make observations about what you find. Ask yourself the following and try to find some answers:

* What type of content are you seeing?
* What type of design are you seeing?
* What makes a portfolio good and another one bad?
* How much focus is on the portfolio itself?

Then after reading the supplemental reading, work on research and progress portfolio and blog site (with three breakpoints and a grid *per page*).

* **Sketch 5 concepts PER PAGE** for a portfolio page, a project page, an about and blog page.
* **Come up with a word list** based on your personality and what you want to to convey through your site about you. (hint: also ask family, friends, others how they'd describe you)
