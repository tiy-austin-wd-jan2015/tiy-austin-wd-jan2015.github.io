* The art of looking: breaking down existing websites into elements / reverse engineering, looking for inspiration, and learning how to be analytical with design
* “design is always visualizing an idea. It’s definitely about drawing attention. its about informing. It’s about distance reading. It’s also about symbolizing something… because like poetry you have to get the essences of something.” — Inge Druckey, [Teaching to see](http://vimeo.com/45232468)
* Breaking apart the different elements of a website: typography, grid, icons, links, navigation, content. -->
