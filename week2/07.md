	* xn+y = z is a good math equation too, if `x` is the number of elements you want to skip (eg. `x = 3` if you want every third element to pick up a style. `y` is the element number you want to start at, eg. if `y = 2`, then start on the second element onwards.)

<!-- ### General understanding of Design
* The art of looking: breaking down existing websites into elements / reverse engineering, looking for inspiration, and learning how to be analytical with design
* “design is always visualizing an idea. It’s definitely about drawing attention. its about informing. It’s about distance reading. It’s also about symbolizing something… because like poetry you have to get the essences of something.” — Inge Druckey, [Teaching to see](http://vimeo.com/45232468)
* Breaking apart the different elements of a website: typography, grid, icons, links, navigation, content. -->
