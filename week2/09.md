### Git review
* Command line
* Making life (git and command line) easier
* Workflow process
* Working on Pull Requests and Issues
* Using README.md for repos

### Pull requests, merge conflicts, and collaborating on Github
- Go to the repo you want to fork
- Click fork button (and see page refresh so repo name has your user name before it.)
- go to bottom right and click SSH link
- Copy address above SSH link
- go to "iron_yard" folder in iTerm
- type `git clone` and paste the SSH link you copied, and hit enter
- `cd` into that repo
- open files and make changes as you want
- go through `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push origin master` as usual
- back on github, refresh, click on "pull request" on the right side of the repo. This should auto connect your forked repo with it's original repo. Type in a message and create pull request
