# {{page.title}}


## Description
Write your first blog post in Markdown about your experience in week 1 and week 2 of the Iron Yard Web Design class. It’s totally okay to totally be yourself and write in first person and be honest about your experience. Think of it like a written huddle highs and lows. What have you liked? What have you not liked? Feel free to include links to any of your projects, any articles you loved/hated reading, or even links to your github profile. **Remember to use Markdown syntax on this**. Soon, we will add them to an actual blog.
