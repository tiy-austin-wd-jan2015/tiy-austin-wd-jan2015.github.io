# {{page.title}}


## Description
Responsive web design includes the use of media queries. As discussed in class, we will be building from mobile and global-first to large breakpoints. That means we start with mobile-friendly and older browser and device friendly CSS and then use `min-width` media queries from smallest to largest after that. For this next phase of Surf & Paddle, refactor your existing code to make surf and paddle responsive. Add a global/mobile breakpoint, a medium size, and include your original large/desktop one. Use your sketches from part one to come up with concepts and ideas.
