[Day 0{{page.day}} : {{page.date}}]({{ site.url }}/week{{ page.week }}/0{{ page.day }}.html) Extra Assignment

# {{page.title}}


## Description
As a web design on the web, you will sometimes be tasked with creating an html page simply from an image file. In this assignment, youâ€™ll be taking an image and turning it into a functioning website. **We will divide this project into *two* components** so for now, only create the layout (as boxes with dimensions and a background color).

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this assignment, you should:

* Understand the proper use and function of html tags.
* Understand and able to leverage the many css properties to style content.
* Use CSS to create layout for the HTML page.


### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use

* Use sectioning html tags
* Effectively utilize float or display styling
* Able to leverage and understand the use of `absolute` vs `relative` in context of positioning.
* The menu items need to also have differing states based on a hover, and although not articulated in the provided image, they need to be styled.


## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo/folder containing at least:
  * `index.html`
  * `styles.css`
  * `images/`

* Images and fonts will be supposed in part two of this assignment.


### Details
* Using the image located `assets/surf-and-paddle.png`, create a html document using html and css to look like below, but be a function website: ![Surf and paddle image](07_surf_and_paddle.png)

* Use this [Google Chrome Perfect Pixel plug-in](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=en) to create the HW, which allows you to overlay the PNG in your browser. You will need to install the plugin to make it work.

* The resulting web page cannot just be an image of the assignment centered on the page :)

* Just a reminder, at this point it should only be positioned boxes and lorem Ipsum text. Tomorrow, you will receive the photos, and will discuss overlays/hovers.
