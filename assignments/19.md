[Day 0{{page.day}} : {{page.date}}]({{ site.url }}/week{{ page.week }}/{{ page.day }}.html) Extra Assignment

# {{page.title}}


## Description
Using Google Fonts, make 5 CodePens each with an h1, h2, and p. Each CodePen should be inspired about something you read on [Design is History](http://designishistory.com). For example, if you read about Gutenburg, try to use a Google Font on CodePen that is like the old-style letters in Gutenburg's work (use google too!). You should remember how to use google fonts, but the notes on how to use google fonts are on [Surf and Paddle's PART TWO](http://tiy-austin-wd-jan2015.github.io/assignments/08.html) notes

* Create 5 CodePen's (one for each inspiration). Feel free to experiment with colors, and other design elements, but the type should match the style. Use text from the history site that takes about the inspiration in the h2 and p, and give the h1 the title of your inspiration. Have fun with this!
