[Day 0{{page.day}} : {{page.date}}]({{ site.url }}/week{{ page.week }}/0{{ page.day }}.html) Extra Assignment

# {{page.title}}


## Description
As a web design on the web, you will sometimes be tasked with creating an html page simply from an image file. In this assignment, you’ll be taking an image and turning it into a functioning website. **We will divide this project into *two* components** so for now, only create the layout (as boxes with dimensions and a background color).

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this assignment, you should:

* Understand the proper use and function of html tags.
* Understand and able to leverage the many css properties to style content.
* Use CSS to create layout for the HTML page.


### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use

* Use sectioning html tags
* Effectively utilize float or display styling
* Able to leverage and understand the use of `absolute` vs `relative` in context of positioning.
* The menu items need to also have differing states based on a hover, and although not articulated in the provided image, they need to be styled.


## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  * `index.html`
  * `styles.css`
  * `images/`

* Images and fonts will be supposed in part two of this assignment.


### Details
* Using the image located `assets/surf-and-paddle.png`, create a html document using html and css to look like below, but be a function website: ![Surf and paddle image]({{ site.url }}/assignments/07_surf_and_paddle.png)

* Use this [Google Chrome Perfect Pixel plug-in](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=en) to create the HW, which allows you to overlay the PNG in your browser. You will need to install the plugin to make it work.

* The resulting web page cannot just be an image of the assignment centered on the page :)

* Just a reminder, at this point it should only be positioned boxes and lorem Ipsum text. Tomorrow, you will receive the photos, and will discuss overlays/hovers.
