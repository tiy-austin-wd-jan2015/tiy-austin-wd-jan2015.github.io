## Description
Create a CodePen in which you create a grid system. Show you ability to use math, CSS theories of classes and box model to make a 12-column grid for future CSS projects.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this assignment, you should:

* create a customized grid system
* Understand the foundation of how basic grid systems are built


### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively

* use CodePen to create a customized grid
* make adjustments to columns to better use and understand grids.



## Details

### Deliverables

* One CodePen saved to your own account and post it in the class chatroom.

### Requirements

Create a CodePen that explores multi-column grid layouts for web design. There must be 12 columns, with a gutter of 20px in between them, in a container sized to 1140px. Give all columns a `box-sizing` of `border-box` and a padding of 5px each. Then, create the following column based combinations (which in total equal 12 columns):


* 6 + 6
* 2 + 6 + 4
* 3 + 3 + 6
* 5 + 7
* 8 + 4
* 9 + 3


**Label each column with the number of columns it takes up**

**Bonus**: Make the Grid SCSS friendly.
