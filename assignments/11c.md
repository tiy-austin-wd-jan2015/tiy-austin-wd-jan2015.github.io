## Description
Create a CodePen that explores multi-column grid layouts for web design. There must be 12 columns, with a gutter of 20px in between them, in a container sized to 1140px. Give all columns a `box-sizing` of `border-box` and a padding of 5px each. Then, create the following column based combinations (which in total equal 12 columns):

6 + 6
2 + 6 + 4
3 + 3 + 6
5 + 7
8 + 4
9 + 3

**Label each column with the number of columns it takes up**
