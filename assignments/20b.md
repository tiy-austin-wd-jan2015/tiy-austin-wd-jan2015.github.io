# {{page.title}}


## Description
Review everything we've been reading and learning this week about grid and type. It is important to follow the rules of typography, especially when learning why the rules exist. Then using your word list, research, and TypeCast account, create **10 different** type specimens exploring different ideas you have for the restaurant project.

Make sure your specimen includes styling for: h1, h2, h3, a, p, item name, item price, item description.

 Explore colors as well, and make sure any decision you make has reasons to back it up. We will review all 10 specimens on Monday.

**MAKE SURE YOU ONLY SELECT TYPEFACES FROM TYPEKIT AND GOOGLE**
