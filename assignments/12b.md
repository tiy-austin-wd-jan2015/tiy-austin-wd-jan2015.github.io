# {{page.title}}


## Description
A big part of the design process is to sketch out website layouts and use that before jumping into Photoshop and Illustrator to design them. Sketching inside of your dot-grid notebooks should help you try to stay neat but without feeling you need to use rulers for every part of it. Try to keep sketches neat but not too neat. :)

For this part of the assignment, use 1 page of your sketchbook for each site.
