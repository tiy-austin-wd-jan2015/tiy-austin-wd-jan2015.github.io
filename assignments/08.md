# {{page.title}}


## Description
As a web design on the web, you will sometimes be tasked with creating an html page simply from an image file. In this assignment, youâ€™ll be taking an image and turning it into a functioning website. **We have divided this project into *two* components** so these are the directions for part two.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this assignment, you should:

* Understand the proper use and function of html tags.
* Understand and able to leverage the many css properties to style content.
* Use CSS to create layout for the HTML page.
* Incorporate images and fonts into your coded layout, and make any layout changes to HTML and CSS as needed.

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use

* Use sectioning html tags
* Effectively utilize float or display styling
* Able to leverage and understand the use of `absolute` vs `relative` in context of positioning.
* The menu items need to also have differing states based on a hover, and although not articulated in the provided image, they need to be styled.
* Adjust CSS once "client" has provided assets (images and fonts)


## Details

### Deliverables

* A folder/repo containing at least:
  * `index.html`
  * `styles.css`
  * `images/`

* Then copy "images" folder from the above downloaded zip folder, into the surf and paddle folder
* Add images links to the HTML file if `img` and CSS if they should be used as a `background-image`

	![]({{ site.url }}/images/google-fonts/step-4.png)

* Make any adjusts to all the text elements. Use lorem ipsum generators to put any place holder paragraphs, and then type out any element that has specific text manually (like the block quote).
