[Day 0{{page.day}} : {{page.date}}]({{ site.url }}/week{{ page.week }}/{{ page.day }}.html) Extra Assignment

# {{page.title}}


## Description
Let's start thinking about sketching responsively some more!

Here are five fixed width (pixel sites) that don't have breakpoints. Sketch out the global, medium, and large size. Feel free to take liberties with redesigning the large size if you feel it can be redesigned.

Use the following format for all sketch sizes, where global is 10-dots wide, medium is 15 dots wide, and large is 20-dots.
