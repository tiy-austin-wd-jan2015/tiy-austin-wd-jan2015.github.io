# Day {{ page.day }} : {{page.time}}


## Today we covered

### Sass and Sketching
* Just chatting about it

### JEKYLL (important notes)
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is Github's service that creates static HTML and CSS from markdown and Sass.
* All Markdown files need to have [front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/)
* All blog Markdown posts put have the filename format 2015-02-11-title-name.md, where it starts with the year, dash month, dash day, dash title name. Blog posts also have front matter. See more about posts [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)
* _config.yml should be adjusted to make changes to info about the site
* To view changes locally run `jekyll serve` (or in Dawn's case `bundle exec jekyll serve`) and then in Chrome look at the website address `http://localhost:4000`
* Setting up Jekyll on your Github Page (username.github.io)
