## Today we covered

### Sass and Bourbon
* [Install Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
* [Install Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install)
* [Install Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/)
* [Sass intro](http://sass-lang.com/guide)
* [Helpful hints for Sass](http://iamsteve.me/blog/entry/sass_hints_tips)
* .scss, not .sass
* Sass creates the CSS file for you, while Sass allows the designer to write things in a easier, more organized way, and use more complicated functions like math equations and grids!
* Variables, mix-ins, and partials
* Convert to a scss file
* `Command + T` to open a new file
* `sass —watch foldername/stylesheetfilename.scss`
* `Ctrl + C` to quit process
* `Command + Shift + P` to access Package Controls


### An introduction to grids on the web
* Use of grids on the web
* Common considerations: columns, gutters
* Sizing grids
* Rule of Thirds, Golden Mean, 12/18/24-column grids

### HTML and CSS details
* Text and box shadow
* [blockquote](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote)
* nth-of-type
	* [nth-of-type calculator](http://css-tricks.com/examples/nth-child-tester/) (Thanks, Dawn!)
	* [Useful nth-of-type recipes](http://css-tricks.com/useful-nth-child-recipies/) (Thanks, Dawn!)
	* xn+y = z is a good math equation too, if `x` is the number of elements you want to skip (eg. `x = 3` if you want every third element to pick up a style. `y` is the element number you want to start at, eg. if `y = 2`, then start on the second element onwards.)
