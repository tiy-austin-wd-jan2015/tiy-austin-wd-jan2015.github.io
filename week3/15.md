## Today we covered


### Responsive Web Design
* Flexible Grids
	* Flexible = percents
	* `Target / context = result`  or `child element / parent element`

* Flexible images and media
	* `img { max-width: 100%;}`
	* videos and iframes rely on javascript

* Media Queries (using min-width and good practices, like mobile-first)
	* `@media screen and (min-width:___px) {  }` with styles nested within brackets.

* Em-based typography
	* pixel type is hard to zoom on typography (unlike page zoom)
	* ems and rems (which weâ€™ll discuss soon)
	* pixels can be a fallback for rems

* Device testing is awesome, but we also need to think device agnostically.



## Homework
Everyday a bit of written, audio, or video resources will be assigned to review, which will supplement class assignments. Assignments are always due by 8:59am of the following day, unless noted. Thursday homework is usually due Monday morning, unless noted otherwise.
