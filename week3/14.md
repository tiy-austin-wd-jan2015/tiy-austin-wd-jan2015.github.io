# Day {{ page.day }} : {{page.time}}


## Today we covered

### JEKYLL continued
* `{ % % }` — ruby beestrings
* `{ { } }` — Liquid
* “Includes” are on every page
* “Layouts” allow designers to create different layouts for different pages
* filename.md plans create a folder called ‘filename’ through `jekyll serve` with an index.html (address would be filename/index.html)
* filename.html files stay as filename.html files
* HTML can be included in markdown files but cannot wrap around markdown (e.g. divs), so use “layouts” for that
* For blog posts remember to use front matter and remember to name files as year-month-day-title.md inside the ‘posts’ folder
* Sass partials live in the ’sass’ folder while the main.css file lives in the ‘css’ folder and imports all the parts so that ‘_site’ only shows the compiled css file
* Remember to push to `master` and `gh-pages` branches
* Setting up Jekyll
