## Today we covered

### Responsive Web Design
* Flexible Grids
	* Flexible = percents
	* `Target / context = result`  or `child element / parent element`

* Flexible images and media
	* `img { max-width: 100%;}`
	* videos and iframes rely on javascript

* Media Queries (using min-width and good practices, like mobile-first)
	* `@media screen and (min-width:___px) {  }` with styles nested within brackets.

* Em-based typography
	* pixel type is hard to zoom on typography (unlike page zoom)
	* ems and rems (review from last week)
	* pixels can be a fallback for rems

* Device testing is awesome, but we also need to think device agnostically.

* Responsive patterns with the homework

* It's really important to be consistent about how elements are specified from section to section. [This CodePen](http://codepen.io/samkap/pen/GgQLJb) explains why.
* RWD sites must include this "meta viewport" code: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`
* [Screen sizes](http://screensiz.es)
* [Another example](http://codepen.io/samkap/pen/LIhzj) of canceling out `nth-of-types` when working with media queries and being very specific and very consistent.
* For font-size conversions, the `target / context = result` formula still applies, where the context is `16px` if the `body {font-size: 100%}` (default). If you change it to `body {font-size: 62.5%}`, the context is `10px`, which some people consider easier to convert to.
* Display: none (is okay for now until JS)

#### Assignments
* Update your Grid Codepen with 1-column grid for all of the same class names. Use media queries for the multi-column grids and break the one-column grid at 500px.

## Extra Assignments
Done with the required homework and would like more to learn from? TIY has you covered.

* Once you complete the above, try your hand at...

* Sketch out how you'd retrofit Surf and Paddle from it's current state to a 1-column layout.
