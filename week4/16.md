# Day {{ page.day }} : {{page.time}}


## Today we covered
* Responsive patterns with the homework
* How to retrofit Surf and Paddle from a planning/sketching standpoint
* It's really important to be consistent about how elements are specified from section to section. [This CodePen](http://codepen.io/samkap/pen/GgQLJb) explains why.
* RWD sites must include this "meta viewport" code: `&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&rt;`
* [Screen sizes](http://screensiz.es)
* [Another example](http://codepen.io/samkap/pen/LIhzj) of canceling out `nth-of-types` when working with media queries and being very specific and very consistent.
* For font-size conversions, the `target / context = result` formula still applies, where the context is `16px` if the `body {font-size: 100%}` (default). If you change it to `body {font-size: 62.5%}`, the context is `10px`, which some people consider easier to convert to.
