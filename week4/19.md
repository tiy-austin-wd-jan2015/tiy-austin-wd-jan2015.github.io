## Today we covered TYPOGRAPHY!

* Font versus Typeface
* Type crimes
	* using the incorrect dash
	* no `line-height` or leading
	* kerning lowercase letters
	* stretching letters
	* ignoring orphans or widows, but honestly this is almost impossible in web design.
	* Centering body copy.
	* Indenting the first paragraph.

* Choosing and combining type:
	* Consider the medium for which the typeface was originally created
	* When using digital adaptations of letterpress faces, choose fonts that are faithful to the spirit as well as the letter of the old designs.
	* Choose faces that suit the task as well as the subject
	* Start with a single typographic family. Choose versatile typefaces. More font-weights, more glyph options, etc. Some of the classic ones stand the test of time better than new and overly styled typography.
	* Choose a face whose historical echoes and associations are in harmony with the text.
	* Allow the face to speak in its natural idioms
	* Choose faces whose individual spirit and character is in keeping with the text.
	* Do your research when using italics, and bolds...especially on the web. The browser can create fake weights.
	* If a typeface has titling or display weights, keep those for larger titles.
	* Pair serifs and sans serifs based on their inner structure.
	* Pair serifs and sans serifs based on their x-height.
	* Ignore the Photoshop/Illustrator metrics, and set type by **looking** at it.
	* Hang your punctuation if possible.

* When you start designing with typography:
	* Typography exists to honor content.
	* Read the text before reading it.
	* Analyze and map it. How can it be interpreted?

* What makes a good typeface?
	* It stands the test of time.
	* Consistent
	* Legible
	* Spacing
	* Meticulous kerning
	* Even color (not as in colorful, but that ever letter has the same visual presence)

* Technical considerations and tips
	* smaller text needs more leading
	* taller x-heights need more leading than shorter x-heights
	* Keep line length between 45 â€“ 75 characters including spaces and punctuation between lines to assist with readability
