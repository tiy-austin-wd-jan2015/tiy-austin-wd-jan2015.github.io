    <p><a href="/week4/16.html">Day 016 : Feb 16, 2015</a> Extra Assignment</p>

<h1 id="surf-and-paddle-now-with-responsive-part-2">Surf and Paddle, now with Responsive (Part 2)!</h1>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Responsive web design includes the use of media queries. As discussed in class, we will be building from mobile and global-first to large breakpoints. That means we start with mobile-friendly and older browser and device friendly CSS and then use <code>min-width</code> media queries from smallest to largest after that.</p>

<p>Before continuing with the second stage of the RWD Surf &amp; Paddle, complete sketches and <a href="/assignments/15.html">part 1</a>. For this next phase of Surf &amp; Paddle, refactor your existing code to make Surf &amp; Paddle responsive. Add a global/mobile breakpoint, a medium size, and include your original large/desktop one. Use your sketches from part one to come up with concepts and ideas.</p>

<p>Make sure to read through the reading assignments as they will help you make it through this assignment.</p>

<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>

<h3 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h3>

<p>Upon completion of this assignment, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consider options on how to retrofit desktop layouts into RWD-friendly media queried ones.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="performance-objectives">Performance Objectives</h3>

<p>After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use</p>

<ul>
  <li>media queries</li>
  <li>meta viewports</li>
  <li>Sketches-to-code processes</li>
  <li>experimentation in code! Get creative. There isn’t a wrong answer! Just try something out!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

<h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An HTMl file that include the meta viewport code</li>
  <li>A responsive version of surf and paddle.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="details-1">Details</h3>
<p>Upload to “tiy_assignments” until “day_16” as “surf_paddle_rwd”. Hint: copy existing surf and paddle into this folder and work on code from there.</p>
