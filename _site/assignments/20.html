<h1 id="restaurant-project--wordlist">Restaurant Project / WordList</h1>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>If done right and early, research can make for a successful project kick off. Part of that research is Googling, interviewing, checking out different perspectives and ideas, mentioning the obvious and exploring the unique or more . It’s about being aware of the symbols, sayings, culture, references, competitors, vernacular, colors, historical context, and millions of other elements related to a project. The more you research, the easier it is to make design decisions and hit the ground running.</p>

<p>Using you sketch book or a Markdown file, create a word list of everything you can think of related to your restaurant. Then add words related to the words of your restaurant that are a few degrees away. Do not edit. Write down every word that comes to mind!</p>
